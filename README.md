That's the Mod Manager but fully rewritten from scratch with the new features:
 - Resizable window
 - Embedded console
 - "Mafia Punch:tm:" button (for killing editor when it not respond)
 - Batch-building more than one mod at once
 - Fully dark themed
 - Better Asset Replacements editor
 - Mod configuration editor
 - Clipbook generator (from gif)
 - Asset exporter (works with SoundNodeWaves and Texture2D)
 - Custom workshop uploader with advanced features
 - Search bar
 - Script watcher (it auto compile scripts when you modify something in it) - disabled by default
 - Mod list context menu
 ... and more!
